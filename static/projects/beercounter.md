### App that helps you count your beer consumption

Beercounter was created as a social media app, meant to be used by a small group of people. It had features such as uploading your photos, rating a specific beer, seeing yours and other people statistics (points, drank beers/alcohol/volume, likes). It brought together friends, and made holiday time a bit more special than usual.
